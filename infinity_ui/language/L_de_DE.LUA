The truth is that never in recorded history has a non-rabid or non-charmed wolf attacked any creature having an equal or higher intellect than itself. (The chance of encountering a rabid wolf that would attack anything is 1%, if a lone wolf is encountered.) Northern wolves exhibit colors from pure white, to grey, to black. Southern wolves are reddish and brown in color. Although fur coloration vary with climate, all wolves have various features in common.

Wild dogs fight as an organized pack. They favor small game, and attack men and human habitations only in times of great hunger. They are found almost anywhere, run in packs, and are led by the dominant male. The pack usually hunts a variety of game, even attacking deer or antelope. Pups are born in the spring. Wild dogs can be tamed if separated from their pack.",

It is made from a ghoulish collection of stolen human body parts, stitched together to form a single composite human body. Its skin is the sickly green or yellow of partially decayed flesh. A flesh golem smells faintly of freshly dug earth and dead flesh. No natural animal, such as a dog, will willingly track a flesh golem. It wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions, and no weapons. The golem can not speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff jointed gait, as if it is not in complete control over its body parts.",
    RGB_DRYA = "Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites. They are as elusive as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise - or they wish to be spotted. The dryad's exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden's. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad's complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad's hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color. This enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad's hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad's skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her. Dryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear. They speak their own tongue, as well as the languages of elves, pixies, and sprites. Dryads can also speak with plants.",

They have human skin tones ranging to a light yellow-green, and their hair can be almost any color, though silver and dark green are the most common. Sirines have beautiful figures and wear scanty clothing at best. Most sirines are antisocial, so they try to drive intruders away, with evil sirines taking stronger measures. Other sirines are hungry for social interaction, and try to lure male humans or demihumans to join them for a time. ",

Their skins are a lustrous green and are thinly covered with coarse black hair. Their eyes are similar to a cat's and are gold in color. Often they can be heard at night, speaking in their high, whispery voices. Tasloi speak their own tongue and can also speak the languages of monkeys and apes. About 5% of their kind have learned a pidgin common that they use when trading.",

Great enmity exists between werewolves and wolfweres. The human forms of werewolves have no distinguishing traits. The werewolf form is equally varied. Many have a bipedal form that is a hybrid of human and lupine features. These creatures are about 1-foot taller and stronger than their human forms. The bodies are fur-covered and have short tails, wolflike legs, and heads that are combinations in varying degrees of human and lupine features. A second form of hybrid is more wolflike, and may be mistaken for a large wolf when it runs on all four legs. This hybrid can also walk erect and has humanlike hands. Another type of werewolf (about 20%) looks exactly like a large wolf about the size of a bear. This creature has no human features, although the eyes may glow red in the dark. ",
    RGB_WOWE = "The wolfwere is an evil and hateful creature that delights in the brutal slaying of humans and demihumans alike. In many cases, the wolfwere is able to attack its victims with utter surprise because of its ability to assume the shape of a human of exceptional charisma. The wolfwere is able to assume a wide variety of shapes at will. Transformation from one form to another takes only a single round. Its true shape, and that in which it prefers to spend the vast majority of its time, is that of a large wolf. When in this state, it is almost indistinguishable from a dire wolf. When a wolfwere is attempting to lure humans or demihumans into an ambush, it will assume the shape of member of their race. Almost without exception, the new persona will not be of the same sex as the potential victim. Thus, a wolfwere which is stalking a male elf will transform itself into a female elf. In all cases, the newly disguised wolfwere will have exceptional physical beauty. ",
	RGB_XVAR = "Xvarts are a cruel, cowardly race of humanoids which live in hilly, cavernous regions. They occupy a place in humanoid society somewhere between goblins and kobolds.

Although weak individually, they are extremely prolific, and are almost always encountered in large groups. ",

Those encountered on the Prime Material plane have almost always been summoned by wizards to fulfill a specific task. The true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Material, Astral, or Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be perceived as a shimmering air mass which looks much like the refraction effect caused by hot air passing in front of cold. Invisible stalkers understand the common speech of men, but can not speak it. They can converse only in their own language, which sounds much like the roaring and whooshing of a great wind storm. ",
    RGB_RATS = "The Rat, a ubiquitous creature of the darkened alleys and forgotten sewers, scurries with an aura of skittishness and primal survival instinct. Born from the teeming masses of urban sprawl and the decaying depths of ancient ruins, the Rat embodies the essence of scavenging and adaptability, its wiry form adorned with coarse fur and twitching whiskers. With its keen senses and nimble movements, the Rat navigates the hidden recesses of the world with cautious curiosity and wary vigilance.",
	RGB_BAND = "The Bandit, a lawless renegade of the open road, roams with an aura of reckless abandon and roguish charm. Born from the fringes of society and forged in the crucible of desperation, the Bandit embodies the essence of freedom and defiance, their rugged attire adorned with stolen trinkets and ill-gotten gains. With their cunning tactics and swift blades, the Bandit preys upon the unwary, striking fear into the hearts of travelers and merchants alike.",
	RGB_DROW = "Long ago, dark elves were part of the elven race that roamed the world's forests. Not long after they were created, though, the elves found themselves torn into rival factions - one following the tenets of evil, the other owning the ideals of good (or at least neutrality). A great civil war between the elves followed, and the selfish elves who followed the paths of evil and chaos were driven into the depths of the earth, into the bleak, lightless caverns and deep tunnels of the underworld. These dark elves became the drow. The drow no longer wish to live upon the surface of the earth. In fact, few who live on the surface ever see a drow. But the dark elves resent the elves and faeries who drove them away, and scheme against those that dwell in the sunlight.",
	RGB_ETTI = "Ettins, or two-headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat they can catch. An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two heads. On closer inspection, however, the creature's vast differences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily apparent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide. This is because an ettin never bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime. An ettin's right head is always the dominant one, and the right arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left. An ettin wears only rough, untreated skins, which are dirty and unwashed. Obviously, ettins smell very bad, due to their complete lack of grooming habits -- good or bad.",
	RGB_GOBL = "These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their great numbers. Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed. They always walk upright, but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin. Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-looking colors. Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of humans. In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak in the kobold, orc, and hobgoblin tongues. ",
	RGB_LIZA = "Typically only found in tropical regions, lizard men are primitive bipeds with a well developed social structure and advanced religious beliefs. Lizard men tribes are typically led by a lizard king who is significantly larger and more powerful than his kin. Lizard men do not come into conflict with humans often, but their fondness for the taste of human flesh often causes problems.",

They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not confused in these places, which gives them an advantage over their prey. Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular. They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male. Their fur is brown to black while their body coloring varies as would a normal human's. Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt. ",

With snakelike bodies and vaguely human limbs, yuan-ti hide in secret vaults until the time is right to strike out at their enemies. Yuan-ti are extremely intelligent foes with very sophisticated magical talents. They are known for their cunning minds, poisonous traps, and vile religious rituals.",
	RGB_MUMM = "Mummies are corpses native to dry desert areas, where the dead are entombed by a process known as mummification. When their tombs are disturbed, the corpses become animated into a weird unlife state, whose unholy hatred of life causes them to attack living things without mercy. Mummies are usually (but not always) clothed in rotting strips of linen. They stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and are supernaturally strong.",

It can survive for centuries as the steadfast protector of its lair, killing all who would defile its holy resting place. Greater mummies look just like their more common cousins save that they are almost always adorned with (un)holy symbols and wear the vestments of their religious order. They give off an odor that is said to be reminiscent of a spice cupboard because of the herbs used in the embalming process that created them. Greater mummies are keenly intelligent and are able to communicate just as they did in life. Further, they have an inherent ability to telepathically command all normal mummies created by them. They have the ability to control other mummies, provided that they are not under the domination of another mummy, but this is possible only when verbal orders can be given. ",
	RGB_MYCO = "Myconids, or fungus men, are a race of intelligent fungi that live in the remote reaches of the Underdark. They are cautious creatures that deplore violence; myconids have no desire to conquer anybody and would prefer to be left alone. Myconids resemble walking toadstools in human form. Their flesh is bloated and spongy and varies in color from purple to gray. Their wide feet have vestigial toes and their pudgy hands have two stubby fingers and a thumb on either side. They have no spoken language.",
	RGB_ORCS = "Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding. They are the hereditary enemies of goblins and hobgoblins, with whom they often compete for resources. Reasonably intelligent carnivores, orcs are constantly waging war against other races to maintain their tribes. These wars thin the weak predators from their tribes and gather resources for the next generation. Orcs have a reputation for being extremely powerful warriors. Wizards have tried to create orcish variants to take advantage of the race's natural ferocity and strength.",
	RGB_MIST = "The crimson death is a malevolent, vaporous creature that feeds on the bodily fluids of its victims. The body of the crimson death is a humanoid-shaped cloud of pale color. It is difficult to distinguish if seen against fog and nearly invisible to infravision. When the creature is fed, it develops a crimson flush that is easily visible by normal or infravision. The cloud possesses humanoid features. The fingers elongate into tentacles when it is feeding. Because of its behavior, sages believe that a Crimson Death Mist is the result of the actual death of a vampire. The crimson death's language is a barely audible series of whispers. It can communicate with other vaporous beings such as air elementals. It communicates with humanoids only if it is their captive.",
	RGB_SALA = "Beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, salamanders are large creatures with the upper bodies of men and the lower bodies of serpents. Salamanders are typically only found in extremely hot and extremely cold environments. As these beings are elemental-kin, they radiate small amounts of elemental energy at all times.

They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back.

The species ranges from the subarctic to the tropics, generally inhabiting wooded or covered terrain.

They are also the most unpredictable and dangerous of the great cats, not hesitating to attack men. Their favorite prey includes cattle, wild pigs and deer. Females raise their 1-3 cubs alone. The cubs remain with their mother for several years. If encountered in the lair, there is a 25% chance that the cubs will be present.

Common mimics occupy about 150 cubic feet (a 3' x 6' x 8' chest, or a large door frame). Killer mimics occupy about 200 cubic feet. Mimics' natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. Mimics can alter their pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (such as marble), wood grain, and various metals (gold, silver, copper); it takes one round to make the desired alteration.

Dismal swamps, marshes, and rain forests are their favorite living areas, but some wet, subterranean places also serve as shambler lairs. They are solitary beasts, rarely living in the same area with other shamblers - usually only in areas where the food source is constant, near famous ruins, or abandoned gold mines. Shamblers are almost totally silent and invisible in their natural surroundings; opponents suffer a -3 penalty to surprise rolls.

They taste matter with their antennae, or feelers; if a substance tasted is organic, the beetle grasps it with its mandibles, crushes it, and eats it.

The average imp is a 2' humanoid with leathery, bat-like wings, a barbed tail, and sharp, twisted horns. Its skin is a dark red and its horns and jagged teeth are a gleaming white. The imp can polymorph itself into two other animal forms. The most commonly encountered alternate forms are those of a large spider, raven, giant rat, or goat. In such forms the imp is physically identical to a normal animal. ",
	RGB_QUAS = "The Quasit, a fiendish familiar bound to serve dark sorcerers and infernal masters, skitters through the shadows with an aura of malevolent glee and unholy mischief. Manifesting in the mortal realm through dark rituals and infernal pacts, the Quasit embodies the essence of demonic temptation and diabolic servitude, its impish form adorned with leathery wings and jagged claws. With its fiendish intellect and supernatural abilities, the Quasit serves as a constant companion and agent of chaos to those who dare to summon it.",
	RGB_DRAG = "The Dragon, an ancient and majestic creature of legend, soars through the skies with an aura of awe-inspiring power and primal majesty. Born from the primordial forces of creation and bound to the natural order of the world, the Dragon embodies the essence of raw elemental energy and draconic might, its massive form adorned with shimmering scales and formidable claws. With its draconic intellect and mastery of arcane magic, the Dragon commands respect and fear from all who behold its magnificent presence.",
	RGB_GOLE = "The Ice Golem, a towering sentinel of frozen fury, strides through blizzard-ridden landscapes with an aura of chilling majesty and elemental power. Crafted from the icy depths of glacial caverns and bound by ancient sorceries, the Ice Golem embodies the essence of winter's wrath, its crystalline form gleaming with frost and snow. With its colossal frame and icy fists, the Ice Golem strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare to trespass upon its frozen domain.",
	RGB_GOLB = "The bone golem is built from the previously animated bones of skeletal undead. These horrors stand roughly 6 feet tall and weight between 50 and 60 pounds. They are seldom armored and can easily be mistaken for undead, much to the dismay of those who make this error. Bone golems are no more intelligent than other forms of golem, so they will not employ clever tactics or strategies in combat. Their great power, however, makes them far deadlier than they initially appear to be. There is a 95% chance that those not familiar with the true nature of their opponent will mistake them for simple undead. ",
	RGB_GOLN = "The Brain Golem, a grotesque fusion of intellect and animating force, strides through arcane laboratories with an aura of eerie intellect and unnatural vitality. Crafted from the harvested minds of scholars and infused with the essence of eldritch energy, the Brain Golem embodies the essence of cerebral supremacy and arcane mastery, its form pulsating with arcane energy and pulsing with arcane energy. With its telepathic abilities and formidable mental prowess, the Brain Golem strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare to challenge its psychic might.",
	RGB_GOLJ = "The Juggernaut Golem, a colossal behemoth of unyielding might, thunders across the battlefield with an aura of unstoppable force and mechanical precision. Forged from the molten depths of ancient foundries and imbued with the essence of relentless determination, the Juggernaut Golem embodies the essence of destruction and mechanical supremacy, its massive frame adorned with reinforced plating and crackling energy. With its thunderous footsteps and pulverizing fists, the Juggernaut Golem strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare to stand in its path.",
	RGB_KUOT = "Kuo-toa are an ancient race of fish-men that dwells underground and harbors a deep hatred of surface dwellers and sunlight. A kuo-toan presents a cold and horrible appearance. A typical specimen looks much like a human body, albeit a paunchy one, covered in scales and topped with a fish's head. The huge fish eyes tend to swivel in different directions when observing an area or creature. The hands and feet are very long, with three fingers and an opposing digit, partially webbed. The legs and arms are short for the body size. Its coloration is pale grey, with undertones of tan or yellow in males only. The skin has a sheen from its slimy covering. The color darkens when the kuo-toan is angry and pales when it is badly frightened. A strong odor of dead fish follows it around. It wears no clothing, only leather harnesses for its weapons and gear. Typically, a kuo-toan warrior carries daggers, spears, shields, harpoons and weighted throwing nets.",
	RGB_MEPH = "Mephits are nasty little messengers created by powerful lower planes creatures. They are evil and malicious by nature and appear on the Prime Material Plane only to perform evil deeds. Six types of mephits are known: fire, ice, lava, mist, smoke, and steam. Each is created from the substance for which it is named. Mephits appear as thin, 5-foot humanoids with wings. Their faces have exaggerated features, including hooked noses, pointed ears, wide eyes, and protruding chins. Their skin continually oozes the stuff from which they were made. Mephits speak a common mephit tongue. ",
	RGB_TROL = "Inherently violent and aggressive, trolls frequently attack with little or no provocation. They attack humans and small human settlements regularly, destroying everything in their path. Trolls are not only feared for their large, powerful limbs, but for their ability to rapidly regenerate most wounds inflicted on them. Experienced adventurers carry fire and acid with them when expecting trolls.",
	RGB_LICH = "The lich is potentially the most powerful form of undead known to exist, and they are difficult, if not impossible, to destroy. Besides having the power of an undead wizard at their command, they store their life force in a secure location separate from their physical form. Destruction of their body is meaningless unless the container is found as well.",
	RGB_VAMP = "Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the world, none is more dreadful than the vampire. Moving silently through the night, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compassion. Unless deep underground, they must return to the coffins in which they pass the daylight hours, and even in the former case they must occasionally return to such to rest, for their power is renewed by contact with soil from their graves. One aspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a vampire's true nature is revealed only when it attacks. There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence. ",
	RGB_YETI = "Sometimes confused with the abominable snowman, the yeti is a distant cousin to the great carnivorous apes of warmer climates. An adult yeti stands 8 feet tall and is covered in long, white fur. Their feet and hands are wide and flat, which helps to disperse their great weight (about 300 pounds) on treacherous snow fields. They travel on all fours like the apes, but fight very comfortably standing erect. Unlike most apes and gorillas, the yeti does not have an opposable toe on its feet. They wear no clothing or ornamentation. The spoor, or smell, of a yeti is very subtle in cold climates, but in confined or warm areas, they have a strong, musky odor. The eyes of a yeti are icy blue or almost colorless. Their claws and flesh are ivory white. Unlike many arctic creatures, the yeti does not have a thick layer of body fat to keep it warm. Instead, it relies upon the special properties of its thick, warm fur. It has a transparent second eyelid, which allows the creature to see in blowing snow, and prevents its eyes from freezing in extreme temperatures.",
	RGB_ELVE = "Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. There are six racial divisions of elves within the realms: gold elves, moon elves, wild elves, sea elves, dark elves (drow), and winged elves (avariel).",
	RGB_SOUL = "The Shattered Soul, a tormented specter of lost identity and fractured existence, drifts with an aura of haunting sorrow and spectral anguish. Born from the shattered remnants of a once-whole spirit and bound by the chains of unresolved trauma, the Shattered Soul embodies the essence of fragmented consciousness and spectral unrest, its ethereal form flickering with fractured memories and unresolved emotions. With its mournful wails and spectral manifestations, the Shattered Soul strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare to peer into the abyss of its fractured psyche.",
	RGB_CRUS = "The crusader warriors are fervent followers of Caelar Argent, the Shining Lady. They are devout believers in her cause, seeing themselves as righteous defenders of the realm against the forces of darkness. Clad in gleaming armor adorned with the symbol of their crusade, they march into battle with unwavering faith and determination. Trained in both martial combat and religious doctrine, they blend the skills of a seasoned warrior with the fervor of a religious zealot.

With its razor-sharp claws and fiery breath, the Hell Cat strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare to challenge its demonic might.",
	RGB_LEMU = "The least of the hordes of the lawful evil baatezu, lemures are the incarnate spirits of the truly evil. They are used as ballista-fodder for the Blood War, and are barely intelligent. You need magic weapons or holy items to hurt them, it seems, for their gelatinous flesh seals behind any wounds you might inflict.",
	RGB_GFEY = "Feyrs (pronounced 'fears') are created from the remnants of ordinary nightmares, mixed with residual magical energies, and unknowingly brought to life by the strong emotions of a large group of people. They are most commonly found in large cities that have a good number of mages, priests, and other spellcasters. Normal feyrs stalk the streets at night, seeking nothing more than to create havoc. Great feyrs, on the other hand, are the combination of lesser feyrs, and may be found anywhere, though they a much rarer than the common feyrs.",
	RGB_OROG = "Elite orcs, or orogs, are a race of great orcs, possibly mixed with ogre blood. Orogs range between 6 and 6½ feet tall. They are highly disciplined warriors and have their own standards and banners which they display prominently - it is usually easy to tell when orogs are present among common orcs. Orogs can be found at the vanguard of large orc armies, but rarely on patrol. There is a 10% chance that an orc tribe will have orogs, whose number equals 10% of the male population. (Thus a community of 3,000 male orcs has a 10% chance of having 300 additional orogs.) Small bands of elites (20-80 orogs) will hire themselves out as mercenaries. Orogs wear plate mail and have are much stronger than orcs. For every 20 orogs, there will also be one leader. Orogs use weaponry common to orcs, but will typically possess two weapons apiece. ",
	RGB_OTYU = "Otyughs (Aw-tee-ug), also known as the gulguthra, are terrifying creatures that lurk in heaps of dung and decay, waiting for something to disturb it. There are two varieties, the regular otyugh, and its larger, more intelligent offshoot, the neo-otyugh. They feed on dung and wastes from other dungeon creatures (gulguthra means 'dung eaters') but also enjoy an occasional snack of fresh meat. Otyughs have huge, bloated bodies covered with a rock-like skin that is brownish gray in color, which is in turn covered with dung. They stand on three thick legs that give them slow ground movement but enable them to pivot quickly. They have three eyes on a leaf-like stalk that moves quickly from side to side, enabling them to scan a large area. The eye stalk is also a receiver/transmitter for their telepathic abilities. Otyughs have a huge mouth with very sharp teeth in the center of their mass. They also have two tentacles with leaf-like ridges that they use to smash and grapple their opponents. The tentacles are covered with rough thorn-like projections. Neo-otyughs have smaller mouths than otyughs. ",
	RGB_DRBL = "The Drowned in Blood, a macabre undead entity born from the depths of tragic demise and ghastly transformation, lurks with an aura of haunting dread and insatiable hunger. Created from the tormented souls of those who met their end drowning in a sea of crimson, the Drowned in Blood embodies the essence of relentless pursuit and ravenous consumption, its grotesque form dripping with congealed gore and festering wounds. With its elongated claws and blood-stained maw, the Drowned in Blood instills terror in the hearts of those who cross its path.",

Born from the macabre fusion of necrotic energy and skeletal remains, the Bone Bat embodies the essence of nocturnal terror and undead menace, its skeletal form adorned with remnants of desiccated flesh and sharpened bone.

	RGB_UMBE = "Residents of the Underdark, umber hulks are huge, incredibly powerful monsters with thick, scaly hides, sharp mandibles, and two sets of eyes. They use strong talons to shred through rock at a frightening speed, often taking unsuspecting miners by surprise. The most debilitating power of the umber hulk is its ability to cause confusion with its gaze. Many adventurers have made their final mistake by looking into the eyes of an umber hulk.",
	RGB_SLAV = "The Athkatlan Slaver, a sinister purveyor of human misery and depravity, prowls with an aura of vile corruption and ruthless exploitation. Residing in the seedy underbelly of the city of Athkatla, this unscrupulous individual embodies the essence of moral decay and callous indifference, their demeanor adorned with ostentatious wealth and the stench of cruelty.

Frost giants have snow-white or ivory skin. Their hair is light blue or dirty yellow, with matching eyes. They can live to be 250 years old.",
	RGB_GIAV = "Known as human behemoths, these human giants inhabit areas infested with hill giants and ogres. Verbeeg vary in height from 8½ to 10 feet tall, and weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. They are unusually thin for their height, although this does not inhibit their fighting ability. Some have minor deformities, such as club foot, uneven eyes, hair lips, etc. In all other respects they appear human, including skin, hair, and eye color. They wear as much protective clothing and armor as they can obtain, which isn't much. Usually they wear furs and hides with pieces of metal armor stitched into strategic places. They almost always carry shields and have the best weapons they can steal. Typically this means clubs and spears. ",
	RGB_GIAH = "Hill giants are selfish, cunning brutes who survive through hunting and by terrorizing and raiding nearby communities. Despite their low intelligence, they are capable fighters. Hill giants are oddly simian and barbaric in appearance, with overly long arms, stooped shoulders, and low foreheads. Even though they are the smallest of the giants, their limbs are more muscular and massive than those of the other giant races. The average hill giant is 16 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. Females have the same builds as males. Their skin color ranges from a light tan to a deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, and their eyes are black.
